Independent Component Analysis in Python for Cocktail Party Problem and other problems.

To run the code for the Cocktail Party Problem, simply download all the files in the repo and put them in one folder. Then simply run cocktail_FOBI.py

I have taken the sound sources from [here](http://research.ics.aalto.fi/ica/cocktail/cocktail_en.cgi). You can download more sounds from there. 

I have implemented the code for two mixed sound sources. It is easy to make it run with more sound sources.
